# Virtual-Piano
PennApps Winter 2017

Virtualso is a guitar hero-style piano game that can be played on any keyboard or piano surface due to its object tracking capabilities.
It uses opencv to determine keypress and keyrelease events on a keyboard, and compares these values to the expected values from a song given a midi file.

Virtualso teaches people how to play piano pieces without the hassle of sheet music. Easy to use for beginners who want to learn any song.
